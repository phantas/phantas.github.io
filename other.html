			<h1>Other projects and interests</h1>
			<hr />

			<p><i>I am a geek in more ways than an interest in tech and maths and have a series of side interests and projects over which I can frequently be found talking enthusiastically about.</i></p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>I am quite passionate about <b>music</b> despite no longer playing or composing anything and have a <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/phantastick/">ridiculous large and diverse collection</a>. I like going to concerts and gigs. I have the vinyl eccentricity, particularly classic and jazz LPs, but am completely dependent on the iPod, iTunes &amp; mp3 variants. I endorse <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">DRM free music</a>. I have a bamboo-type flute which broke in a joint and which I plan to mend in the near future: I would welcome suggestions on how best to glue the two parts together and play it.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>I like <b>travelling</b> and take any opportunity presented to me gladly. I find the idea of documenting (for myself) the places I have been to interesting but I don't seem to have saved many records so far.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>I am <b>bisexual</b> and ended up in a position in 2006 where I found myself being the birth mother of the bisexual community and representation in Portugal. I am, among other things, the creator and admin of a national webpage, <a href="http://www.pontobi.org"><b>.bi</b></a> and national mailing list, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BiPortugal"><b>BiPortugal</b></a>. I organise <a href="http://www.pontobi.org/#eventos">monthly local social meetings and occasional workshops</a> in Porto and Braga and often represent the community in diverse situations. I jokingly say that I am also the one that pokes the LGBT community and activism to consider the <b>B</b> in LGBT.</p>

					<p>I am frequently asked about the nature of these resources and events and my position in them. It has always been my intent that they are seen as independent initiatives and to downplay my role to a more shadowy support position. Contrary to what is often the case in Portugal, I did not wish to create a formal society or organisation nor have a role of a "president" because I wanted a sense of community and representation to emerge. I wanted to ease and encourage others to come forth to whom I could offer my vast experience and connections as support. On the other hand, it was always my plan to move again out of Portugal one or two years after and any of these initiatives would need to be able to continue without me being present and active. I am very happy to see that they are starting to walk on their own feet.</p>
