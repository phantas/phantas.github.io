>Nowadays, several projects have become so complex and large
      that are impossible to develop and maintain as a single
      monolithic block. On the other hand, the ability for an application
      to acquire as much functionality as possible, reusing software and
      without accumulating functionality not needed at that
      moment and, thus, not wasting resources, is also becoming an
      important problem.</P
><P
>These and other problems caused some new strategies to
      develop, in particular, the use of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>plugins</I
>
      and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>components</I

      principles of modularity and implementation facilities like
      <I

      </I
>(e.g., CORBA), permit to overcome these problems in a

></H1
><P
>One of the biggest problems developers have to handle nowadays
    is on how to cope with the enormous size and complexity of an 
    increasing number of current projects. 
    It is common knowledge that from a certain point it is 
    impossible to have the application as a monolithic block. It is 
    necessary to divide the project in different parts, as independent 
    as possible, so that architecting the different parts together is as 
    easy and consistent as possible. This tends to be difficult since
    different teams are only familiar with their parts and the 
    inter-communication is usually low. Also, it is very common nowadays
    to have a project spread in different platforms and locations.
    </P
><P
>On the other hand, it is also usually said that, if a certain 
    functionality is needed and it is already available somewhere, one 
    should reuse this implementation and not "reinvent the wheel". 
    This should account also for using/developing products aside 
    especially for a certain task instead of integrating that 
    functionality in the main application. Besides the reusability,
    this also brings more flexibility and a simpler and clearer main 
    application.
    For instance, consider an application which captures, evaluates and
    stores data where in the evaluation stage, some graphics need to be 
    generated. There are a big number of applications that draw graphics 
    and are probably preferred than to add "from scratch" graphics 
    functionality to the application. But the main problem is whether 
    the graphic program is easily integrated which, most of the times, 
    is not the case.
    </P
><P
>Continuing on the subject of adding/changing functionality and
    considering the same example, imagine that the data it handles is
    very heterogeneous and, thus, the way this data is evaluated, for
    example, is different according to the type of data. When the set
    of the types handled is small and doesn't change and the way they
    are handled is also static, the final product is a bit complex
    but handleable. But when this is not the case several problems appear:

>The program listing above is part of a Gnumeric plugin source 
      code. Gnumeric uses plugins both to handle different formats 
      (e.g., Excel) and add functions not defined (statistical, numerical,...).
      The API the plugin must define is very concise and partial: the 
      plugin registers the new functions it defines (in lines 11-12, the 
      plugin is registering a function, in this example, the factorial 
      function). The <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_plugin()</TT
> function is called
      at start-up. Besides registering the functions it also provides
      information on the Plugin (in this case, the title) and functionality
      to unload the plugin (e.g., check if there aren't any instances left).
      Although Gnumeric plugins are not the best example, since the 
      requirements above are not completely met (Gnumeric is completely
      transparent to the plugin) it provides a very simple example with most
      of the core ideas.

    Imagine a user writing a document or a web page where he

    in the word processor or web page editor would be overloading
    them (how about audio, movie, barcharts...?). Doing it outside
    and importing as an image is also not the best solution. But
    if there is already a mechanism for handling that functionality
    why not reuse it? Basically, the idea is to "embed" the
    graphics mechanism in the word processor or web page editor
    (something like: "when handling this data use this particular
    mechanism"). But to have a good interaction between mechanisms
    we need independence, interface contracts and again components
    appear as a good solution for this.</P
