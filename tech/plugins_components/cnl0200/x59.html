>A plugin is a unit of software intended to extend the
    functionality of an independent application at run-time (see

    It provides several advantages, making this technology very popular 
    among several programs that process heterogeneous data and would, 
    otherwise, be less flexible and heavier (one of the most famous 
    examples being Netscape that uses plugins to handle and/or view 
    special data like audio or movies):

>The application doesn't know the plugin beforehand ( it is
        the plugin's responsibility to present itself) providing
        wider flexibility to what functionality can be added.

><P
>It leads to a complete, clean separation from the main 
        application and the various branches with their separate 
        functionality. Thus we get a lighter main application focused
        on the essentials.

>Plugins are usually implemented as demand-loaded shared 
    libraries. These type of libraries are only loaded on runtime
    as opposed to static whose code is included in the application
    on the compilation stage. They can be loaded in two different
    ways:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>automatically at the start of the process and, thus, only
          unloaded at the end: the library must be linked at compilation
          stage;
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>by request of the program itself (using, for example,
          <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>dlopen()</TT
>): the code can be loaded and
          unloaded in the middle of the process or not even loaded at
          all; furthermore, the library is not linked at compilation
          stage;
          </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>When the library is loaded, the system checks if it is
    already in memory, so that, at most, one copy of the library is
    present in the memory.</P
><P
>Plugins are typically implemented as the second type since
    their characteristics are especially adequate for the "plug"
    concept. But in order to comply with the desired functionality
    of a plugin, the following list of requirements must be met:

>The API is very well defined in the documentation: it contains
      a list of functions provided by Netscape, a list of functions the plugin
      must and can define and structures to be used. Since the communication
      is all done by this total interface, both parts act as complete 
      "black-boxes". Another interesting characteristic is the life cycle of
      a plugin: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Initialize</I
>(when the plugin is first 
      called), <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>New Instance</I
>(each time it is invoked), 
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Destroy Instance</I
>(when a task is completed and that
      instance is no longer needed) and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Shutdown</I
> (when all
      instances are destroyed).

>The program listing above is part of a Gnumeric plugin source 
      code. Gnumeric uses plugins both to handle different formats 
      (e.g., Excel) and add functions not defined (statistical, numerical,...).
      The API the plugin must define is very concise and partial: the 
      plugin registers the new functions it defines (in lines 11-12, the 
      plugin is registering a function, in this example, the factorial 
      function). The <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_plugin()</TT
> function is called
      at start-up. Besides registering the functions it also provides
      information on the Plugin (in this case, the title) and functionality
      to unload the plugin (e.g., check if there aren't any instances left).
      Although Gnumeric plugins are not the best example, since the 
      requirements above are not completely met (Gnumeric is completely
      transparent to the plugin) it provides a very simple example with most
      of the core ideas.
