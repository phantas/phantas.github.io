>There isn't much consensus on what constitutes a component. Although
    this is not complete and may seem to general we can say that a component
    is a unit of software with the following characteristics:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>It is an indivisible unit of independent deployment
        </I
>. The component must be independent from the environment
        and other components and, so, has to encapsulate it's features. It also
        can't be partially deployed since it constitutes an whole.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>It is a unit of third-party composition</I
>.
        A party exterior to at least one component must be able to compose
        them together. The component has to be self-contained, interface 
        hiding and provide a well defined interface
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Has no persistent state</I
>. This way, any
        copy of a component won't differ from the original so that, at most,
        one copy of the component is present.
        </P
></LI
></OL
><P
>A typical use is in big, complex and heterogeneous projects 
    divided in different parts, each with its particular function and 
    interacting with other parts of the project, being developed by
    different teams and where each part doesn't want to know how the 
    other parts are implemented or where they are located. Basically, 
    each part constitutes a component. An interface contract for each 
    component is established and interaction is done through these
    interfaces.
    </P
><P
>Another example can be found in desktop environments.
    Imagine a user writing a document or a web page where he
    wants to integrate a graphic. Putting graphics functionality
    in the word processor or web page editor would be overloading
    them (how about audio, movie, barcharts...?). Doing it outside
    and importing as an image is also not the best solution. But
    if there is already a mechanism for handling that functionality
    why not reuse it? Basically, the idea is to "embed" the
    graphics mechanism in the word processor or web page editor
    (something like: "when handling this data use this particular
    mechanism"). But to have a good interaction between mechanisms
    we need independence, interface contracts and again components
    appear as a good solution for this.</P

>As an example, GNOME implemented BONOBO in order to comply
    with interoperability between different applications in the desktop
    (e.g, embed a graphics object in a word processor document). BONOBO
    is basically a set of CORBA interfaces and an implementation in
    GNOME/GTK+ of these interfaces that are designed to be simple to use
    and hide CORBA and between-components protocol used. An application
    uses these interfaces to export its functionality or integrate other
    components functionality making it possible to edit a graphic or even
    play GnoMines in a spreadsheet.
