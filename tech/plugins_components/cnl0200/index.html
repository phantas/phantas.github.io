>Nowadays, several projects have become so complex and large
      that are impossible to develop and maintain as a single
      monolithic block. On the other hand, the ability for an application
      to acquire as much functionality as possible, reusing software and
      without accumulating functionality not needed at that
      moment and, thus, not wasting resources, is also becoming an
      important problem.</P
><P
>These and other problems caused some new strategies to
      develop, in particular, the use of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>plugins</I
>
      and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>components</I
> which, using some old
      principles of modularity and implementation facilities like
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shared libraries</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>middleware
      </I
>(e.g., CORBA), permit to overcome these problems in a
      clean and standard way.</P

><P
>One of the biggest problems developers have to handle nowadays
    is on how to cope with the enormous size and complexity of an 
    increasing number of current projects. 
    It is common knowledge that from a certain point it is 
    impossible to have the application as a monolithic block. It is 
    necessary to divide the project in different parts, as independent 
    as possible, so that architecting the different parts together is as 
    easy and consistent as possible. This tends to be difficult since
    different teams are only familiar with their parts and the 
    inter-communication is usually low. Also, it is very common nowadays
    to have a project spread in different platforms and locations.
    </P
><P
>On the other hand, it is also usually said that, if a certain 
    functionality is needed and it is already available somewhere, one 
    should reuse this implementation and not "reinvent the wheel". 
    This should account also for using/developing products aside 
    especially for a certain task instead of integrating that 
    functionality in the main application. Besides the reusability,
    this also brings more flexibility and a simpler and clearer main 
    application.
    For instance, consider an application which captures, evaluates and
    stores data where in the evaluation stage, some graphics need to be 
    generated. There are a big number of applications that draw graphics 
    and are probably preferred than to add "from scratch" graphics 
    functionality to the application. But the main problem is whether 
    the graphic program is easily integrated which, most of the times, 
    is not the case.
    </P
><P
>Continuing on the subject of adding/changing functionality and
    considering the same example, imagine that the data it handles is
    very heterogeneous and, thus, the way this data is evaluated, for
    example, is different according to the type of data. When the set
    of the types handled is small and doesn't change and the way they
    are handled is also static, the final product is a bit complex
    but handleable. But when this is not the case several problems appear:

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Flexibility and consistency</I
>. How to
        add/change/remove functionality in a flexible manner without 
        compromising the consistency of the application and, preferably, 
        not having to rebuild all the application?</P
></LI

><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Efficiency</I
>. How to do this in a way
        that doesn't compromise to much the efficiency, e.g., there
        isn't a waste of resources since most will only be used for a
        certain period or not even used at all in a session?</P

><P
>Recently, two paradigms have evolved that are especially aimed 
    at this type of problems: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Plugins</I
> and 
    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Components</I
>.
    These enable us to fulfil the following compilation of objectives
    in a clever and transparent way.
    It is easily seen why this two paradigms have become so popular.

>Modularity is one of the keywords. How to divide
          an utility in different parts that obey the rules of modularity
          (independence, encapsulation) and interact with each other in
          a desired way. A special case would be to divide an utility in
          its main part (management) and its several branches, thus,
          separating functionality.

>In other words, to be able to add/change/remove
          functionality of an utility without touching the main part. As
          an add-on, to be able to do that on runtime. This implies that
          the application shouldn't be rebuild and, further more, compiled,
          each time these changes take place.

>The development of each part of a project should 
            be independent from the other ones. This obliges the 
            communication between parts to be transparent and standard.
            Also, each part should be able to cope with the others
            being in different platforms and locations. Basically,
            each part shouldn't have to worry about how others are
            implemented and located.
