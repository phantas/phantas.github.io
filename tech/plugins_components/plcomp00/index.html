>Nowadays, several projects have become so complex and large
      that are now impossible to develop and maintain as a single
      monolithic block. On the other hand, the ability for an application
      to acquire as much functionality as possible, reusing software and
      without accumulating functionality not needed at that
      moment and, thus, not wasting resources, is also becoming an
      important problem.</P
><P
>These and other problems caused some new strategies to
      develop, in particular, the use of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>plugins</I
>
      and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>components</I
> which, using some old
      principles of modularity and implementation facilities like
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shared libraries</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>middleware
      </I
>(e.g., CORBA), permit to overcome these problems in a
      clean and standard way.</P
><P
>This tutorial aims to provide a clear and precise
      description of these paradigms. Special attention is also
      given on how these paradigms can be developed and implementation
      issues like shared libraries and CORBA. To illustrate, several 
      examples are given. A short discussion on important common aspects
      and when these strategies should or not be used concludes the
      tutorial.</P

>This tutorial describes two recent technologies that have 
    become very popular: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Plugins</I
> and 
    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Components</I
>. It's purpose is to provide a
    precise definition of this two paradigms and a formalisation
    of their characteristics. Still, implementation issues are not 
    forgot and technologies like <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shared libraries</I
>
    and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>middleware</I
> by means of 
    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>CORBA</I
> are also focused as well as some very
    short and simple examples.
    </P
><P
>The tutorial starts (<A
HREF="intro.html"
><I
>Introduction</I
></A
>) by presenting 
    several common problems that caused these paradigms to evolve. 
    From these problems a general list of what is desired to be 
    fulfilled is created.</P
><P
>Before describing plugins and components and see how these
    two can handle the problems referred, <A
HREF="shared.html"
><I
>Shared libraries</I
></A
>
    provides a description on shared libraries: what they are, benefits
    and disadvantages, as well as presenting some very useful tools.
    Shared libraries are very important in developing, mainly, plugins
    but can also be a better choice for some problem than requiring
    all the functionality necessary to plugins whose disadvantages
    can overwrite the advantages.
    </P
><P
>Next comes the first paradigm focused: plugins 
    (<A
HREF="plugins.html"
><I
>Plugins</I
></A
>). A short and precise definition is 
    first presented. The pros and cons of this paradigm are examined 
    and by joining these to the experience gathered from plugin-based 
    technologies available, a list of characteristics that should be 
    fulfilled is presented.
    The chapter ends by comparing several publicly available 
    implementations (Netscape, Gnumeric and GIMP) and pointing how 
    some characteristics are or not fulfilled and, finally, a small 
    example.
    </P
><P
>The second paradigm, components, follows in 
    <A
HREF="components.html"
><I
>Components</I
></A
>. The structure is very similar: a short
    and formal definition followed by a discussion on the concept,
    advantages, disadvantages and raised questions. From this, the
    definition is complemented with a list of characteristics that 
    should be fulfilled. A short comparison on components and objects
    is summarised in a table since there are some similarities in the
    two concepts. Next, implementation issues are again approached by
    discussing middleware which constitutes one of the keywords in
    component-based technology and making a short description of CORBA.
    The chapter ends presenting an example: BONOBO, a component-based 
    technology used in GNOME.
    </P
><P
>Finally, in <A
HREF="comparing.html"
><I
>What to choose</I
></A
> it is possible to
    compare the technologies focused in this tutorial that, although
    quite different, have some similarities. Some important, general
    aspects are mentioned as well as some cautions that should be kept 
    in mind.
