>There is sometimes some confusion between plugins and
      shared libraries and what can or cannot be called to be a "plugin".
      This section aims to clarify this concept by presenting
      a short and precise (hopefully) definition of a plugin as well
      as the characteristics that a "true" plugin should fulfill.
      Examples are also given.

>Plugins are a good way of adding functionality to an
      independent application: they can be loaded and unloaded
      during runtime and there is no need to recompile the main
      application when adding a new plugin. This way we can have
      a main application lighter and focused on the "essentials"
      which also brings easier development: instead of an heavy,
      complex, mixed application we have a main application with
      the fundamental parts and a variety of plugins which extend
      the functionality.
      </P
><P
>Plugins are usually implemented as demand-loaded
      shared libraries since these libraries can be loaded on 
      runtime (as opposed to static) which is necessary for
      the "plug" concept characteristic of plugins. Thus, they
      inherit their characteristics.

>Nevertheless, it has to be defined an interface
          that a plugin must implement and must be common to all
          ( in order to use the plugin, the application has to call, at
          least, one function; the reason why this should be common to
          all is related with the last topic and, in particular, comes
          clear if we consider we want to be able to add new plugins
          without modifying the application). But the question now is:

          if the application has no prior knowledge of the plugin, since
          some information must be given, using the plugin will be
          more difficult if this information is complex and big.
          </P

>On the other hand, the plugin has also to have some
          knowledge on the application. Since the plugin is developed

><P
>The first point has to do with the fact that the application
       must run by itself, in other words, it must couple with not having
       a plugin adequate for a particular task ( even if it means, for
       example, discarding the task).</P
><P
>Most of the points before have to do with what was discussed
       before. The "black-box" view and the well defined interfaces in
       both direction enable both parts to be implementation independent
       of the other. So, if there is a change in the version of one of
       the parts, the risk of affecting the other part is lesser (less need,
       if not none at all, to recompile the other part). Also this accounts
       for a clear and standard communication between parts.
       </P
><P
>As was noted, so that there is more flexibility in "plugging"
       the application shouldn't known the plugins in advance. This also
       accounts for the independence between both parts (as an example,
       imagine adding a new plugin or changing by another functionally
       similar).
       </P
><P
>But then how does the application acquire the needed
       information? First, by expecting that the plugin obeys a certain
       defined interface common to all the plugins of that application.
       This interface must provide a function that returns the description
       of the plugin, in particular, what type of task it handles. The
       other important aspect that the application needs to know is what
       function to call so that this particular task is done: this can
       be achieved by either passing this information at the same time
       that the information above is passed, or, by requiring this
       function on the interface common to all (something of the type
       <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>do_work()</TT
>).
       </P
><P
>So, although this interface varies between technologies
       (as can be seen in the examples below), the plugin should provide:
       </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>information on the type of task it can handle</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>a function to be called to handle that type of task
	   (<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>do_work()</TT
>)
	   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>an instance-type strategy including a structure to
	   store all the data of a particular task and a way to know
	   if there aren't any tasks (instances) still working so that
	   the plugin can be unloaded
	   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>a function to initialize the plugin</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Whether the application only accepts the common interface
       or whether the plugin can provide an extension to this interface
       (a total interface opposed to a partial one)
       it's the developers decision but must also be defined
       beforehand so that the application can couple with that.
       If it's a partial one, the extra should also be declared when
       the plugin presents itself.
       </P
><P
>The last point comes mainly from the fact that a plugin is
       loaded at runtime and the separation between it and the application;
       if the plugin has dependencies, it can be very difficult to check
       these dependencies in runtime. This point is desirable but not
       always achievable.

	 in the file pluginrc  and, for each plugin, calls 
	 <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

>Gimp provides access to much of its internals through 
	 a database of procedures where each plugin must insert 
	 itself into. This enables a plugin to call GIMP internal 
	 procedures or other plugins. For example, another plugin 
	 may use <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gimp_run_procedure()</TT
> 
	 to run the randomize plugin.
	 Again this facility can be dangerous so the plugin should
	 check that the desired procedure is in the database before
	 calling it.
	 </P
><P
>To end, an example: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>the randomize plugin.</I
>
	 When the user selects randomize from the menu, Gimp calls
	 the run() function passing the required parameters
	 registered by the gimp_install_procedure() among whose
	 is the "image"; run() launches a dialog box inquiring
	 what type of randomization and the amount of "noise" the
	 user wants, does the required transformation on the
	 image and refreshes the display of the image.
