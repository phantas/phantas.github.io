>One of the biggest problems developers have to handle nowadays
    is on how to cope with the enormous size and complexity of an 
    increasing number of current projects. These projects involve several
    people, possibly, in different teams and locations, developing an 
    heterogeneous software where the different parts have to interact 
    consistently, thus requiring a perfect agreement between teams. 
    The problem gets worst when considering that the product will have 
    to be maintained afterwards or even extended.
    </P
><P
>It is common knowledge that from a certain point it is 
    impossible to have the application as a monolithic block. It is 
    necessary to divide the project in different parts, as independent 
    as possible, so that joining the work of two teams is as easy and 
    consistent as possible.
    Dividing the project is also necessary to limit the scope of the
    problem being handled, enabling easier and clearer development and 
    maintenance. For example, consider a product that captures, evaluates
    and stores some type of data. Now, consider that the way the data is 
    stored is changed or there is a bug somewhere. Having clear 
    distinctions between the different functionalities clearly makes
    this task easier and protects the rest of the product.
    But having a project divided in different parts brings the
    problem of architecting the parts, i.e., joining the different
    parts together. Teams are only familiar with their parts and 
    communication between teams tends to be short. Also, it is very
    common to have the project spread in different platforms and 
    locations.
    </P
><P
>On the other hand, it is also usually said that, if a certain 
    functionality is needed and it is already available somewhere, one 
    should reuse this implementation and not "reinvent the wheel". 
    This should account also for using/developing products aside 
    especially for a certain task instead of integrating that 
    functionality in the main application.
    Besides the reusability of code, it also gives more flexibility 
    (it is easier to add functionality this way than rebuilding the
    all application) and a simpler and clearer main application 
    (instead of having a confusing, heterogeneous and heavy one).
    But this requires some conditions from both parts that should be
    considered before the development of either one.
    For instance, consider the last example. Imagine that in the
    evaluation stage, some graphics need to be generated. There are
    a big number of applications that draw graphics and are probably
    preferred than to add "from scratch" graphics functionality to the
    application. But the main problem is whether the graphic 
    program is easily integrated which, most of the times, is not the case.
    </P
><P
>Continuing on the subject of adding/changing functionality and
    considering the same example, imagine that the data it handles is
    very heterogeneous and, thus, the way this data is evaluated, for
    example, is different according to the type of data. When the set
    of the types handled is small and doesn't change and the way they
    are handled is also static, the final product is a bit complex
    but handleable. But when this is not the case we come upon several
    problems:

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Flexibility and consistency</I
>. How to
        add/change/remove functionality in a flexible manner without 
        compromising the consistency of the application and, preferably, 
        not having to rebuild all the application?</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Efficiency</I
>. How to do this in a way
        that doesn't compromise to much the efficiency, e.g., there
        isn't a waste of resources since most will only be used for a
        certain period or not even used at all in a session?</P

>Recently, two paradigms have evolved that are
      especially aimed at this type of problems:

>Plugins</I

HREF="#FTN.PLUG-IN"

CLASS="EMPHASIS"

      But, in order to understand why the need for this technology arose, 
      we can compile, from the above problems, a list of objectives we would 
      like to fulfil. It is easy to see, looking at the nature of the 
      problems and the following list, why these new paradigms have
      become so popular.</P

>Modularity is one of the keywords. How to divide
          an utility in different parts that obey the rules of modularity
          (independence, encapsulation) and interact with each other in
          a desired way. A special case would be to divide an utility in
          its main part (management) and its several branches, thus,
          separating functionality.

CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Dynamic functionality independent of the 
          main part</I
></DT
><DD
><P
>In other words, to be able to add/change/remove
          functionality of an utility without touching the main part. As
          an add-on, to be able to do that on runtime. This implies that
          the application shouldn't be rebuild and, further more, compiled,
          each time these changes take place.

>Independent development of parts</I
></DT

><P
>The development of each part of a project should 
            be independent from the other ones. This obliges the 
            communication between parts to be transparent and standard.
            Also, each part should be able to cope with the others
            being in different platforms and locations. Basically,
            each part shouldn't have to worry about how others are
            implemented and located.
