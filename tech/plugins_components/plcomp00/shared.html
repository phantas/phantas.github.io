>Basically, a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>library</I
> is a set 
      of functions and/or structures to be used by applications. For example,
      if a programmer wishes to use more complex mathematical functions in C 
      like <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sin</TT
> he would have to use the library 
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>libm</B
> where this and other functions are defined.
      To do so, he can link the library in the compilation stage, using the 
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-l</B
> option with the name of the library (without the 
      lib prefix and the extension: in this case, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-lm</B
>).
      </P
><P
>A <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shared</I
> library opposes to a
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>static</I
> one in the sense that the library is
      only loaded at runtime and not in the compilation stage. So, while
      in static libraries the program carries the library code, when linked
      to a shared one the library code is not present and is only loaded
      into memory when needed.
      </P
><P
>One of the named advantages of shared libraries, and also 
      another characteristic that differs them from static ones,
      is the fact that the system has, at most, one copy of the library's
      code per library. When loading, the system first checks if there
      is already a copy of the library on memory. The code is only
      copied if there is none, while as in static the code is included
      in every compiled program to which the library is linked.
      </P
><P
>So, if the program doesn't carry the library's code, when
      is it loaded? There are two alternatives:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>automatically at the start of the process and, thus, only
          unloaded at the end: the library must be linked at compilation
          stage;
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>by request of the program itself (using, for example,
          <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>dlopen()</TT
>): the code can be loaded and
          unloaded in the middle of the process or not even loaded at
          all; furthermore, the library is not linked at compilation
          stage;

><P
>as stated before it is the application itself which
          requests the loading: the code can be loaded and unloaded
          at any given stage or not loaded at all; this is particularly
          useful when the program may use resources from several 
          libraries but not necessarily at that moment, thus, avoiding
          that dozens of libraries that are not being used would be
          wasting memory;
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>since the library is not linked at compilation stage
          the application doesn't have to know it beforehand: for 
          example, all the libraries can be put in a certain 
          directory where the application will fetch them; this
          enables that resources can be added or changed without 
          touching the application itself;

>First, errors only show at runtime. This makes
          the debugging more difficult but also imposes some care on

><P
>Creating a shared library is more complex and
          requires a few number of flags and details. However,

><LI
><P
>The dynamic loading obliges the code to be

>(PIC).
          This makes the library heavier so, although applications
          are lighter, space is only actually saved if there is
          more than one application linked or there is demand loading;
          </P
